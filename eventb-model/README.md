# ABZ 2024 MLV Case Study in Event-B

The case study is [on Github](https://github.com/foselab/abz2024_casestudy_MLV/). We’re working on [v1.4](https://github.com/foselab/abz2024_casestudy_MLV/blob/main/Mechanical_Lung_Ventilator%201_4.pdf).

The case study CFP is at [https://abz-conf.org/site/2024/casestudy/](https://abz-conf.org/site/2024/casestudy/).

If you’re just here to have a look at the models and don’t want to install Rodin, head to the [text](text/) directory for plaintext counterparts to the Event-B components.
